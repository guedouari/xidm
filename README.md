#cross-platform Internet Download Manager

this is my first public work :) it's still on an early stage

xidm adds downloads to a running aria2 instance via cmd
using the default setting: http://localhost/jsonrpc:6800

usage mode :
xidm [URI] [FILENAME] *FILENAME is optional

best used to link Firefox and Aria2 (with flashgot)
